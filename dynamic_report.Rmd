### Nature of my data
The nature of my data revolves around observations from morning and afternoon walks. Including:

-   Mood after walking

-   Main activity people were doing

-   What the weather was like

-   How many people were passed during the walk

### Analysis from my data
The following analysis was made:

-   The maximum number of people passed on a walk was `r max_peoplePassed`.

-   The minimum number of people passed on a walk was `r min_peoplePassed`.

-   The average mood felt after walking was a `r av_mood` out of 5.

-   The most frequent weather condition was `r most_frequentWeather$weather`.

-   The most frequent activity people were doing as they walking by was `r most_frequentActivity$main_activity`.
